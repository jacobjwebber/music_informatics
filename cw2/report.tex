\section{Introduction}
This report reviews the article ``Probabilistic Grammars for Music'' (PGM) by Rens Bod. The article describes the application of probabilistic parsing techniques that were originally developed for natural language processing (NLP). These techniques are used to predict where musical phrases will begin and end when given a melody line. They are trained and tested for accuracy using the Essen Folksong Collection.

This report will summarise the article in question, before offering a critical review of the claims made.
