# CW2 Submission

This is the submission for cw2. included at top level are a pdf of the report providing
an analysis of the article by Rens Bod and a prolog file
of the extended grammar, miNewExtend.pl. This includes as comments musical examples.

In addition to this mi_extend.pl is also included. This includes some modifications not present in
the later version. specifically allowing duple time. This is respectfully and optimistically
submitted in the hope that it might also warrant some marks for the assessed part of this course.

Addtional directories containing assisting files are included. These are probably not of interest
but should be self explanatory if they are.
